## 📌 Recent Project  

### [H2 UrbanPlus – Hydrogen Energy & Water Recovery Simulator](https://github.com/imadafla/H2_UrbanPlus)  
⚡ **Python**  
A lightweight open-source Python package for simulating **hydrogen-based energy and water recovery systems**.  
It integrates **PV generation, electrolysis, hydrogen storage, fuel cells, and water recovery** for building or district energy system studies.  

🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/imadafla/H2_UrbanPlus)  

### [Surrogate-MPC-EPlus – Multi-Objective MPC for EnergyPlus](https://github.com/imadafla/surrogate-mpc-eplus)  
⚡ **Python | EnergyPlus | TensorFlow | Pymoo**  

A research-oriented framework for **surrogate-based Model Predictive Control (MPC)** in building energy systems.  
It integrates **EnergyPlus co-simulation, LSTM neural network surrogate modeling, and NSGA-II multi-objective optimization** to enable real-time adaptive envelope control (e.g., movable insulation systems).
